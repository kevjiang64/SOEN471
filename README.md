# SOEN471: Big Data

## Abstract

Tennis is interesting because it is an individual sport where the professional players each have their own unique playstyle, techniques, strengths, and weakness. Federer is known for his dominance on grass fields, whereas Nadal dominates clay fields. Match data such as the terrain type, the ability to deliver and handle serves, tiebreaks and matchups could be used to obtain valuable statistics about each player's strengths and weaknesses. [A large 800 MB dataset of over 2 million tennis matches from Kraggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ehallmar/a-large-tennis-dataset-for-atp-and-itf-betting) will be used in this project.
